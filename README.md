A simple Chatroom built in C programming language. The program is built uses multithreading for handling multiple clients.

The makefile must be executed, the server and the client will connect to the port 127.0.0.1 localhost, it receives as an argument the port where you want to connect.

To generate the files, execute the make command, two files will be created, "client" and "server", then it will show how the port should be written

```c
./server 8000
./cliente 8000
```
